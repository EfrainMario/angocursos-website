# angocursos-website
A place where you can learn everything in everywhere

This is a Website that we developed for a client. There is no code hosted because the code is in a private repo. 
I planed and developed the Front-end side with:
- Reactjs configured with vitejs
- React-router-dom for routes
- Recoil for state management
- Mui (ex. material-ui) for styles

I helped to develop and bug fix same beckend features. The beckend was developed with:
- php
- leaf - ph
- mysql
